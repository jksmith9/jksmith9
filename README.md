My partner and I have produced a podcast together! She creates the content and conducts interviews, while I do all of the audio engineering, from recording to production to final mix and masters.

In addition to podcasting, I've composed many musical and orchestral pieces. I've played guitar for over 20 years and piano for 7. See examples below!
