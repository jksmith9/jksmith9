## ðŸ‘‹ My name is Josh and I'm doing my best

I'm a machine learning engineer with a focus on data & advanced analytics implementations. Additionally, I have strong passion for express and thoughtful deployments using MLOps principles. I started off in the NLP space and have loved that area ever since, especially with the growth of LLMs and agentic workflows.

You'll find me here trying out new ideas and committing to my secret work repos ðŸ¤«.


## Data Science

### NLP Exploration

A fun talk I did many years ago consisted of exploring the Harry Potter book series and the word embeddings. The idea was to track how they changed over time and how the cosine similarities drifted or aligned based on which book in the series we were observing. You can find all the resources hosted publicly on this drive link here [bit.ly/hp-vectors](https://bit.ly/hp-vectors). 

The end result is a visual of some examples after creating the word embeddings. A follow up in this space would be test out using an LLM to ask questions about each concept from each book and observe the response adjustments as new texts are added. E.g. Harry being highly related to Gryfindor early in the series, but as we learn of his lineage to house Slytherin, those concepts start to converge.



## Other Fun Endeavors

### Forked 17lands Bot for Magic: The Gathering

I enjoy playing Magic like many other nerds. But, what I find more intriguing is the stats around the enterprise. [17lands.com](https://www.17lands.com/) Is a site that compiles many digital players' data across many sets and formats. Using this data many people have built applications and APIs to utilize this data for products or analysis. 

One such example of this is the 17lands-helper bot here https://github.com/JasonYe4273/17lands-helper from JasonYe4273, ZacharyMN709, and JasonILTG. The project hasn't seen an update in a while and I wanted to make some improvements, so I've forked it here https://github.com/jksmith9/17lands-helper. With that I deployed it using fly.io and few discord integrations to get it to work with some of the discords I use to have the data become queryable for any card in our private discords.

### Podcast Producer

My partner and I have produced a podcast together! She creates the content and conducts interviews, while I do all of the audio engineering, from recording to production to final mix and masters. You can find us here https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ive-been-better/id1550231357 or wherever you get your podcasts.

#### Music Producer

In addition to podcasting, I've composed many musical and orchestral pieces. I've played guitar for over 20 years and piano for 7 years. See some examples below!
